## Build Environment

- Start by installing Rust from rust-lang.org, this will install the current stagle version

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

- Source your bashrc/bash_profile to update your `PATH` variable

```bash
source ~/.bashrc        # Most Linux Distros, some OSX
source ~/.bash_profile  # Most OSX, some Linux Distros
```

- Install the `nightly-2018-01-13` build of rust, `Rocket`, the web-framework relies on some advanced compiler options not yet included in the default build.

```bash
rustup install nightly-2018-01-13
rustup default nightly-2018-01-13
```

- Download and compile the project and all of it's libraries

```bash
cargo build
```

- Create the `hecate` database using the provided schema file.

```bash
echo "CREATE DATABASE hecate;" | psql -U postgres

psql -U postgres -f src/schema.sql hecate
```

- Start the server

```bash
cargo run
```

- Test it is working - should respond with `HTTP200`

```bash
curl 'localhost:8000
```

You will now have an empty database which can be populated with your own data/user accounts.

If you want to populate the database with sample data for testing, [ingalls/hecate-example](https://github.com/ingalls/hecate-example)
has a selection of scripts to populate the database with test data.

## Docker File (Coverage Tests)

The Docker file is designed to give the user a testing environment to easily run rust tests.

Install docker and then run

```
docker build .

docker run {{HASH FROM ABOVE}}
```

## Feature Format

Hecate is designed as a GeoJSON first interchange and uses [standard GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) with a couple additions
and exceptions as outlined below.

*Supported Geometry Types*
- `Point`
- `MultiPoint`
- `LineString`
- `MultiLineString`
- `Polygon`
- `MultiPolygon`

*Unsupported Geometry Types*
- `GeometryCollection`

### Additional Members

The following table outlines top-level members used by hecate to handle feature creation/modification/deletion.

Key/Value pairs in the `.properties` of a given feature are _never_ directly used by the server and are simply
passed through to the storage backend. This prevents potential conflicts between user properties and required
server members.

| Member    | Notes |
| :-------: | ----- |
| `id`      | The unique integer `id` of a given feature. Note that all features get a unique id accross GeoJSON Geometry Type |
| `version` | The version of a given feature, starts at `1` for a newly created feature |
| `action`  | Only used for uploads, the desired action to be performed. One of `create`, `modify` or `delete` |


### Examples

#### Downloaded Features

```JSON
{
    "id": 123,
    "version": 2,
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "shop": true,
        "name": "If Pigs Could Fly"
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [0,0]
    }
}
```

Downloaded Features will return the integer `id` of the feature, the current `version` and the user supplied `properties` and `geojson`.
`action` is not applicable for downloaded features, it is only used on upload.

#### Create Features

```JSON
{
    "action": "create",
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "shop": true,
        "name": "If Pigs Could Fly"
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [0,0]
    }
}
```

A features being uploaded for creation must have the `action: create` property. Since an `id` and `version` have not yet been
assigned they should be omitted. Should an `id` or `version` be included the server will ignore them, assigning a new
`id` and `version` per the servers internal id provisioner.

#### Modify Features

```JSON
{
    "id": 123,
    "version": 1,
    "action": "modify",
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "shop": true,
        "name": "If Pigs Could Fly"
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [0,0]
    }
}
```

A feature being uploaded for modification must have the `action: modify` as well as the `id` and `version` property. The `id` is the integer id of the feature to modify and the `version` property is the
current version of the feature as stored by the server. If the version uploaded does not match the version that the server has stored, the modify will fail. This prevents consecutive edits from conflicting.

Note that the modify operation is _not a delta operation_ and the full feature with the complete Geometry & All Properties must be included with each modify.

Also note that since the `id` pool is shared accross geometry types, an id is allowed to change it's geometry type. eg. If `id: 1` is a `Point` and then a subsequent `action: modify` with a `Polygon` geometry is performed, `id: 1` is allowed to switch to the new `Polygon` type.

#### Delete Features

```JSON
{
    "id": 123,
    "version": 1,
    "action": "delete",
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": null,
    "geometry": null
}
```

A feature being uploaded for deletion must have the `action: delete` as well as the `id` and `version` property. See _Modify Features_ above for an explanation of those properties.

Note the `properties` and `geometry` attributes must still be included. They can be set to `null` or be their previous value. They will be ignored.

### Samples

## Server

This section of the guide goes over various options on has when launching the server

Hecate can be launched with default options with

```
cargo run
```

### Database

By default hecate will attempt to connect to `postgres@localhost:5432/hecate`.

Note that only postgres/postgis backed databases are currently supported.

This database should be created prior to launching hecate. For instructions on setting up the database
see the [Build Environment](#build-environment) section of this doc.

A custom database name, postgres user or port can be specified using the database flag.

*Example*

```bash
cargo run -- --database "<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>/<DATABASE>"

cargo run -- --database "<USER>@<HOST>/<DATABASE>"
```

### JSON Validation

By default Hecate will allow any property on a given GeoJSON feature, including nestled arrays, maps, etc.

A custom property validation file can be specified using the schema flag.

*Example*

```bash
cargo run -- --schema <PATH-TO-SCHEMA>.json
```

Note hecate currently supports the JSON Schema draft-04. Once draft-06/07 support lands in
[valico](https://github.com/rustless/valico) we can support newer versions of the spec.

### Custom Authentication

By default the Hecate API is most favourable to a crowd-sourced data server. Any users
can access the data/vector tiles, users can create & manage data, and admins
can manage user accounts.

This provides a middle ground for most users but all endpoints are entirely configurable
and can run from a fully open server to fully locked down.

If the default values aren't suitable for what you intend, passing in an authentication
configuration JSON document will override the defaults.

*Example*

```
cargo run -- --auth path/to/auth.json
```

__Contents of auth.json__
```
{
    "endpoints": {
        "meta": "public",
        "schema": null,
        "mvt": {
            "get": "user",
            "regen": "admin",
            "meta": null
        },
        "users": {
            "info": "admin",
            "create": "admin",
            "create_session": null
        },

        ....

    }
}
```

It is important to note that if custom authentication is used, _every_ category must be either disabled or have
an option for every sub category within it set. One cannot conditionally override only a subset of of the default options. This is for the security of private
servers, since adding a new API endpoint is a non-breaking change, the server checks that you have specified
a policy for every endpoint or are happy with just the defaults before it will start.

IE:

The below schema is invalid. Each category (schema, user, style) etc. must be specified as disabled or
have a map containing the auth for each subkey.

```
{
    "endpoint": {
        "schema": null
    }
}
```

#### Behavior Types

| Type      | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `"public"`  | Allow any authenticated or unauthenticated user access |
| `"admin"`   | Allow only users with the `access: 'admin'` property on their user accounts access |
| `"user"`    | Allow any user access to the endpoint |
| `"self"`    | Only the specific user or an admin can edit their own metadata |
| `"null"`    | Disable all access to the endpoint (Must be explicitly `null` |

*Notes*

1. This only affectes `public` styles. The `private` attribute on a style overrides this. A `private` style can _never_ be seen publically regardless of this setting.
2. This is a category, the only valid option is `null` this will disable access to the endpoint entirely
3. OSM software expects the authentication on these endpoints to mirror OSM. Setting these to a non-default option is supported but will likely have unpredicable
support when using OSM software. If you are running a private server you should disable OSM support entirely.

<h3 align='center'>OpenStreetMap API</h3>

The primary goal of the hecate project is a very fast GeoJSON based Interchange. That said, the tooling the OSM community has built around editing is unparalled. As such,
Hecate provides a Work-In-Progress OpenStreetMap Shim to support a subset of API operations as defined by the [OSM API v0.6](httpl://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6) document.

*Important Notes*
- All GeoJSON types can be downloaded via the API and viewed in JOSM
- MultiPoints
    - Are represented using an OSM  `Relation`
    - The type will be `multipoint`
    - The member type will be `point`
- MultiLineStrings
    - Are represented using an OSM `Relation`
    - The type will be `multilinestring`
    - The member will be `line`
- Uploading `Way` & `Relation` types are not currently supported, attempting to upload them may produce undesirable results.

The following incomplete list of endpoints are implemented with some degree of coverage with the OSM API Spec but are likely incomplete/or written with the minimum flexibility required to
support editing from JOSM. See the code for a full list.

#### `GET` `/api/capabilities`
#### `GET` `/api/0.6/capabilities`

Return a static XML document describing the capabilities of the API.

*Example*

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8000/api/capabilities
```

---

#### `GET` `/api/0.6/user/details` *Auth Required*

Returns a static XML document describing the number of unread messages that a user has. Every n minutes JOSM checks
this and displays in the interface if there is a new message, to cut down on errors it simply returns a 0 message response.

*Example*

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8000/api/0.6/user/details
```

---

#### `PUT` `/api/0.6/changeset/create` *Auth Required*

Create a new changset and set the meta information, returning the opened id.

*Example*

```bash
curl \
    -X PUT \
    -d '<osm><changeset><tag k="comment" v="Just adding some streetnames"/></changeset></osm>' \
    'http://localhost:8000/api/0.6/changeset/create
```

---

#### `GET` `/api/0.6/changeset/<changeset_id>/upload` *Auth Required*

Upload osm xml data to a given changeset

*Example*

```bash
curl \
    -X POST \
    -d '<diffResult version="0.6">NODE/WAY/RELATIONS here</diffResult>' \
    'http://localhost:8000/api/0.6/changeset/1/upload'
```

---

#### `PUT` `/api/0.6/changeset/<changeset_id>/close` *Auth Required*

Close a given changeset, preventing further modification to it

*Example*

```bash
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:8000/api/0.6/changeset/1/close'
```
