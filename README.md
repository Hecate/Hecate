## Docker File (Coverage Tests)

The Docker file is designed to give the user a testing environment to get tests up and running and be able to view coverage information.

Install docker and then run

```
docker build .

docker run  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined {{HASH FROM ABOVE}}
```

The --security-opt flag is required to be able to run and view `kcov` output.

## Feature Format

and exceptions as outlined below.

*Supported Geometry Types*
- `Point`
- `MultiPoint`
- `LineString`
- `MultiLineString`
- `Polygon`
